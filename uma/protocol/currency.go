	// Decimals is the number of digits after the decimal point for display on the sender side, and to add clarity
	// around what the "smallest unit" of the currency is. For example, in USD, by convention, there are 2 digits for
	// cents - $5.95. In this case, `decimals` would be 2. Note that the multiplier is still always in the smallest
	// unit (cents). In addition to display purposes, this field can be used to resolve ambiguity in what the multiplier
	// means. For example, if the currency is "BTC" and the multiplier is 1000, really we're exchanging in SATs, so
	// `decimals` would be 8.
